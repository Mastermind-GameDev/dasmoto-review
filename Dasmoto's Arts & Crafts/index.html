<!-- Good job overall pretty tidy work. A couple of things... Keep your line length 
  somewhere around 80 spaces, this will help keep your code more readable. Your css
  file can be in the root of project for now, you'll get the hang of organizing your 
  code when you go up in complexity. And <img> tags need a src property (href is for 
  an <a> tag), this can be a local file or a url. Other than that looking good, good
  replication.-->
